{% comment %} 1. Settings:
    - get link from home view to work
    - pass group members to the html
    - pass group name to the html
    - pass group picture url to the html:
        a) Maybe use {% if picture_url %}<script> set url as background photo </script>{% endif %}
    - make all group member buttons as checked:
        a) maybe add a hidden input as a switch
    - Collect unchecked members ids, send to backend and delete
    - Send picture and group name to backend and save {% endcomment %}
2. Chat_view:
    {% comment %} - split up chat view to conversation_view and group_view {% endcomment %}
    - Enable sending messages:
        {% comment %} a) use ajax to send the message and refresh page {% endcomment %}
        {% comment %} b) use signals to add message to the second conversation side after adding it to first one {% endcomment %}
        {% comment %} c) think of splitting templates to group and conversation (in groups nicks have to be displayed and in conversations not)
            1) Make missing front end with nicks
        c) send messages to front end
        d) figure out how to display which messages are mine (if message.author == request.user: class="my_message")
        e) Maybe show messages without refreshing the page by clearing input value
           and adding message with javascript on the client side {% endcomment %}
        {% comment %} g) In javscript when adding sent messages attach to them id returned from backend  {% endcomment %}
        h) figure out how to listen for new messages in javascript without refreshing page
    - Enable server messages (Group was created, Someone was added etc.)
